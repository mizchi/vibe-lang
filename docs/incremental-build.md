# Incremental build design

Status: design and measurement plan. The current compiler has persistent loader
and type-environment caches, but the final build still merges and code-generates
the whole program. This document defines the user-visible target before changing
that architecture.

## Goals and non-goals

The primary goal is to reduce the latency a user observes after an edit. Compiler
selfbuild is an important large-project workload, but is not a substitute for
measuring ordinary projects.

The first implementation step is measurement. It must not change cache keys or
claim file-level code generation is safe. Generated compiler bundles are neither
benchmark inputs to edit cases nor files that the benchmark may update.

## User-visible KPI contract

Measure these endpoints separately:

1. edit to the first accurate diagnostics;
2. edit to settled diagnostics for that revision;
3. edit to a runnable debug artifact;
4. edit to completion of a selected test;
5. edit to a runnable release artifact.

An editor/daemon request carries a source revision. A diagnostic or artifact for
an older revision must never be published as the result of a newer revision.
`stale_publish_count == 0` is a correctness gate, not a timing metric.

Each endpoint is measured cold and warm, with p50 and p95 reported independently
for small, medium, and compiler-sized projects. The edit matrix is:

| Case | Expected future invalidation |
|---|---|
| Exact no-op | No semantic work |
| Comment or whitespace only | No semantic work after canonical hashing |
| Private function body | Owning semantic unit; consumers keep typing results |
| Private signature | Dependent declarations in the same module/package |
| Export implementation, same interface | Consumer typechecking is reused |
| Export type/effect/contract | Complete reverse-dependency closure |
| Generic definition | Template and affected specializations |
| Import or `index.vpkg` | Module plan and affected reverse dependencies |
| Syntax error introduced/fixed | Affected diagnostics, with no stale publish |
| Root module | Worst-case reference case |

Wall time is advisory on shared runners. Deterministic work counters are suitable
for blocking gates: files read, modules parsed/rechecked/reused, interfaces
changed, functions code-generated, cache hits/misses by class, and invalidated
reverse dependencies. Artifact identity, diagnostics, guest heap, host RSS, and
bytes read/written are recorded alongside timings.

The initial executable baseline is `scripts/edit_cycle_kpi.mjs`. It measures the
one-shot `vibe check` path for cold, exact warm/no-op, comment-only, private-body,
and public-interface edits. It requests a disabled-by-default compiler sidecar
for deterministic `db_typecheck_fs` work counters: modules planned, rechecked,
reused, and parse operations. It intentionally does not yet measure LSP
residency, runnable artifacts, or complete invalidation/codegen counts. Its
purpose is to establish whether current persistent caches produce a measurable
user-visible effect before implementing a new artifact format.

### Initial local result (2026-08-02)

Ten repetitions with compiler SHA `7a2632fc5753` and runner SHA
`dac03e9834c9` produced:

| Case | median | p95 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Cold cache | 216.0 ms | 250.4 ms |
| Exact no-op, preserved cache | 218.2 ms | 283.7 ms |
| Comment edit | 216.7 ms | 238.7 ms |
| Private body edit | 229.5 ms | 246.7 ms |
| Public interface edit | 222.3 ms | 317.3 ms |

This tiny two-file, one-shot check shows no stable user-visible cache win: the
cases are within timing noise and process/runner startup dominates. This is a
useful negative baseline. The next measurement should retain the same cases but
use a resident process and a medium import graph; only after telemetry is added
can the timing be attributed to parse/typecheck/invalidation reuse. These local
numbers are advisory and are not a committed regression budget.

A follow-up run with compiler SHA `4ceba401a979` added deterministic
`db_typecheck_fs` work counters. Every run planned two modules:

| Case | rechecked | reused without body parse | parse operations |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Cold cache | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| Exact no-op, preserved cache | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Comment edit | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| Private body edit | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| Public interface edit | 2 | 0 | 2 |

This confirms a real no-op cache win hidden by process startup, but also confirms
the current invalidation problem: even comment-only and private-body edits
recheck the leaf and its consumer. `modules_reused` means any successful module
that avoided a full body parse; it may come from in-memory or persistent state
and is not yet a per-cache-class hit count. The next implementation target is
therefore interface/implementation fingerprint separation, preceded by an
invalidation model/oracle rather than more wall-time tuning.

## Artifact boundaries

A physical file is a useful ingestion/cache shard, but is not always an
independent semantic or code-generation unit. Files in one package can share a
namespace, and declarations can form dependency cycles. Use two layers.

### Physical file artifact

- CST/tokens and recovering parse diagnostics;
- import header and declaration index;
- source spans, documentation, and source map;
- source and canonical semantic fingerprints.

### Semantic module or declaration-SCC artifact

- resolved bindings;
- inferred public type, trait, and effect schemes;
- evidence requirements;
- normalized typed generic IR;
- direct dependency assumptions;
- separate interface and implementation fingerprints.

The scheduler may ingest files independently, but typechecking and codegen reuse
must follow semantic declaration SCCs or module boundaries rather than assuming
that every file is isolated.

## Fingerprints and invalidation

Maintain at least two identities:

- **Interface fingerprint:** canonical exported names, types, layouts promised by
  the contract, trait bounds, and effect schemes.
- **Implementation fingerprint:** normalized implementation IR plus every
  optimization assumption that can affect generated code.

A dependency implementation change with an unchanged interface permits reuse of
a consumer's typing derivation. It does **not** imply unchanged program behavior;
the final linked artifact must still include the new implementation. An artifact
that embeds or specializes dependency code must include that dependency's
implementation fingerprint in its key.

Cache namespaces should eventually be versioned by phase (resolution, parser/AST,
type/interface, link plan, codegen/runtime) rather than invalidating every cache
class on every compiler-source change.

## Normalization and optimization boundary

Normalization used for identity must be deterministic and distinct from
profitability-driven optimization.

### Canonicalization and typed elaboration

Safe candidates for early caching are normalized paths/imports, alpha-normal or
stable symbol identities, canonical type-variable numbering, canonical ordering
of record fields/effect rows/constraints, resolved bindings, type/effect
elaboration, pattern desugaring, and source maps stored separately from the IR.
Comments and whitespace may be excluded from a semantic fingerprint while the
physical source fingerprint still tracks exact editor content.

### Context-independent local optimization

Initially allow only transformations whose assumptions are local and explicit:
closed pure constant folding, CFG simplification, unreachable local block
removal, local DCE that preserves exports, and proven beta/eta reductions.

Cross-module inlining, specialization, or dictionary/evidence elimination is
reusable only when all referenced implementation identities, normalized type
arguments, evidence ABI, target, and optimization mode are in the cache key.

### Whole-program barriers retained initially

Keep export-collision renaming, private namespace rewriting, entry-root DCE,
generic-instantiation closure, global function/type/table/effect index planning,
final representation/memory layout, Wasm section assembly, and whole-program
RC/escape optimization at the coordinator/link step until an independently
linkable fragment format is proven byte- and behavior-equivalent.

## Generics

The internal artifact retains generic schemes and typed generic bodies. A
specialization cache, if introduced, is keyed by:

```text
definition symbol + implementation fingerprint
+ normalized type arguments + evidence/dictionary ABI
+ target/backend + optimization ABI
```

The linker can choose specialization or a uniform dictionary/evidence-passing
representation. Erasing generic parameters in a current backend is not evidence
that a generic module can be represented safely as an independently reusable
Wasm file.

## Component Model decision

The Component Model is a promising package, distribution, host-integration, or
remote compiler-service boundary. It is not the primary internal incremental
artifact format.

WIT does not directly carry arbitrary parametric generic bodies, polymorphic
effect rows, unresolved relocations, specialization requests, or compiler typed
IR. Encoding these through resources, variants, or bytes would lose useful static
information and may add Canonical ABI lift/lower and ownership costs. A component
import can act like an operation dictionary only after the relevant value types
and ABI are concrete.

Use this initial pipeline:

```text
source
  -> typed generic module artifact (internal cache boundary)
  -> specialized/core object fragment
  -> deterministic whole-program linker
  -> core Wasm or wasm-gc
  -> optional Component Model wrapper (package/external boundary)
```

A Component Model experiment should be package-level, monomorphic, and limited
to WIT-admissible exports. Compare build latency, artifact size, runtime overhead,
and composition reuse against direct core-Wasm linking before expanding it.
Putting opaque typed IR in a component custom section is possible, but then the
component is only a container and provides little advantage over a versioned
content-addressed artifact.

## Lean model and proof obligations

The bounded Lean invalidation model lives in
`formal/VibeFormal/Compiler/Incremental.lean`, with proofs and executable
examples in `formal/VibeFormal/Proofs/IncrementalCorrect.lean`. It models
snapshots with distinct source ingestion, interface, and implementation
identities, direct imports, reverse-closure interface invalidation, and
owner-only typing invalidation for implementation-only edits and owner
invalidation for dependency-plan changes. Source-only edits are telemetry and
model no typing invalidation.
It also distinguishes matching consumer typing-cache assumptions from linked
artifact freshness: an unchanged imported interface may keep a consumer cache
key eligible while a changed dependency implementation still makes any artifact
that recorded that implementation stale. The model contains fingerprints, not
typing derivations, so language-level typecheck reuse safety remains a separate
proof obligation. This is a relational model-level contract, not yet an
executable invalidation planner; the model itself does not alter production
cache keys. The bounded observation bridge below compares its observation-only
exported-interface identities, source ingestion identities, provisional
canonical token-stream implementation identities, and telemetry, but cannot
compare production cache-key interface identities or normalized typed-IR implementation
identities because those do not yet exist.

A later conformance bridge must add production interface identities and
final-artifact inputs, then establish correspondence between the executable
planner and the Lean relation before cache-key changes are proposed.

### Current bounded observation bridge

`vibe check` remains unchanged unless both of these environment variables opt
in to the trace sidecar:

```text
VIBE_INCREMENTAL_INVALIDATION_TRACE_OUT=<sidecar.json>
VIBE_INCREMENTAL_INVALIDATION_TRACE_NONCE=<unique-non-empty-run-id>
```

The sidecar is schema version 3 and is written **only after a successful
check**. It includes the nonce, canonical module path, direct dependencies,
`compact_string_fingerprint` of each module's **ingested source**, distinct
version-tagged `implementation_fingerprint` and `interface_fingerprint`, the
observed current TypeDb decision (`rechecked` or `reused`), and aggregate work
telemetry. The interface identity hashes a canonical
`vibe-module-interface:v1` serialization of exported inferred value/function
types (including effects), exported public type/trait/effect/effectset
declarations, and re-exports. Quantified variables are alpha-normalized;
effect rows, bounds, derives, and effectset members are lexically
sorted/deduplicated. Bodies, comments, private declarations, and ordinary
imports are excluded. The compiler removes a pre-existing requested sidecar
before the check, rejects a missing nonce, and refuses to publish a partial
trace when an observation is missing. Callers must reject a missing sidecar or
a nonce mismatch as stale/failed rather than reusing old data.

`source_fingerprint` remains explicitly **not an interface or implementation
fingerprint**; it is ingestion telemetry only. `implementation_fingerprint` is
an observation-only `vibe-module-token-stream:v1` hash over a length-delimited
sequence of each lexer's token kind and exact source lexeme. It preserves every
parser-visible syntax distinction, including fields that today's unlocated AST
or printer erases, while excluding comments and whitespace between tokens,
spans, and the module filesystem path. Literal/interpolation lexemes remain
exact, so formatting inside one lexical token may conservatively change this
identity. It is intentionally **not normalized typed IR** and makes no
optimization or artifact-freshness claim. `interface_fingerprint` is likewise
observation-only:
it is computed from the successful typed environment for rechecked modules and
reconstructed from the existing cached environment plus current source surface
for reused modules. The token-stream and interface reconstructions are not
charged to the existing TypeDb `parse_operations` counter, so the
`rechecked`/`reused` report remains the current conservative cache-path
observation rather than a claim about total sidecar work. None of these fields
is read by a production cache lookup, changes a reuse decision, or changes a
persistent cache format. Consequently current decisions remain measurements of
conservative behavior, not formal conformance assertions.

`formal/IncrementalOracleMain.lean` renders the committed deterministic corpus
at `formal/oracle/incremental-invalidation.tsv`; `formal/check-incremental-oracle.sh`
rejects corpus drift. `scripts/incremental_invalidation_oracle.mjs` runs an
isolated-cache, temporary three-module chain through no-op, comment-only,
private-body, public-interface, and dependency-plan edits. An external
executable shadow planner treats source changes as ingestion telemetry, derives
owner typing invalidation from canonical token-stream implementation changes
and dependency-plan changes, and reverse-closes interface changes over the union of
the before/after dependency graphs. For the bounded corpus it compares that
plan with the relational model rows, requires every planned module to appear as
`rechecked`, and reports additional rechecks as conservative over-invalidation.
A missing required recheck fails the oracle.

For this comparison, `source_fingerprint` is ingestion telemetry only;
`implementation_fingerprint` is the provisional owner-change trigger. It is
not normalized typed IR. The shadow planner is independently implemented bridge
code, not a proved extraction of the Lean relation or a production planner. It
rejects module-universe changes and dependencies outside the observed universe
rather than silently assigning them semantics.

Required properties are:

1. **Clean-build equivalence:** incremental build after edits has the same
   canonical diagnostics, artifact, and modeled execution trace as a clean build
   of the edited snapshot.
2. **Typecheck reuse safety:** unchanged imported interfaces preserve the
   validity of a consumer's cached typing derivation.
3. **Invalidation completeness:** every artifact whose recorded assumption
   changed is included in the invalidated set.
4. **Schedule determinism:** worker order and cache hit/miss choices do not alter
   the canonical result.
5. **Normalization correctness:** local normalization preserves typing,
   interface, and observable evaluation/effect traces.
6. **Generic compatibility:** specializing normalized generic IR is
   observationally equivalent to normalizing the corresponding specialization.

These remain conditional obligations. The current selfhost bridge observes
dependencies, source ingestion fingerprints, provisional canonical token-stream
implementation fingerprints, reuse decisions, and a versioned canonical
exported-interface fingerprint, and the bounded shadow planner performs the
comparison described above. It does not provide normalized typed-IR or
artifact-input identities, canonical-diagnostic trace equivalence, a
compiler-to-Lean proof, or production planner conformance.

### Bounded artifact-input compile trace

Artifact-input tracing is a separate compile-path slice: `vibe check` reaches
the check-only path and does not exercise persistent runnable-artifact
lookup/store. The current bounded implementation opts in only to the
`file_compile` persistent **pre-strip WASI bump** lane:

```text
VIBE_FS_COMPILE=1
VIBE_RC=0
VIBE_ARTIFACT_INPUT_TRACE_OUT=<sidecar.json>
VIBE_ARTIFACT_INPUT_TRACE_NONCE=<unique-non-empty-run-id>
```

It rejects a missing nonce and every incompatible early/special,
LSP/check-only, instrumented/RC/testmeta lane, deletes a requested old sidecar
before any CLI-mode return or validation, writes the wasm first, then writes the
trace as the final sidecar operation. A failed compile or validation therefore
leaves no trace to be mistaken for this run. Ordinary compile dispatch remains
unchanged when `VIBE_ARTIFACT_INPUT_TRACE_OUT` is empty; this wrapper does not
alter a production cache key, on-disk format, or reuse decision, and it does not
instrument `fs_compile`, module, or profiled lanes.

Schema version 1 records the nonce and scope disclaimer, exact `compile_lane`,
persistent artifact kind, entry path/name/mode,
`source_groups_fingerprint` with its exact builder kind, derived
`artifact_input_fingerprint` with its exact builder kind, and the hit/miss from
the cached compile's own persistent lookup that returns bytes or proceeds to
compile them. It deliberately does not claim a normalized implementation
identity or a new safe artifact boundary.

`pkf run test-artifact-input-trace` runs strict Node parser/schema tests.
`scripts/artifact_input_trace_oracle.mjs <stage2.wasm>` is the isolated
fresh-stage2 oracle used by `scripts/compiler_gate.sh`: it requires cold miss /
warm hit stable identities, a dependency edit changing both identities, and
failed/no-nonce plus LSP/check-only conflicting runs removing stale sidecars.

## Delivery order

1. Record the current edit-cycle baseline and add cache/invalidation telemetry.
2. Observe source, canonical token-stream implementation, and interface
   identities; prove invalidation-plan properties in Lean and compare real traces
   with the oracle. **Promotion gate:** replace the provisional token-stream
   identity only after a
   normalized typed-IR serializer has deterministic round-trip/differential
   coverage and clean-build artifact parity; only then propose cache-key or
   reuse-policy changes.
3. Cache a minimal typed module/SCC artifact and require clean-build parity.
4. Add generic-template and specialization caches only after their assumptions
   are explicit.
5. Introduce deterministic object fragments and reduce whole-program barriers.
6. Run a package-level Component Model A/B experiment.
7. Apply the same KPI harness to compiler selfbuild and only then set regression
   budgets from repeated measurements on a stable runner.
