-- POSIX pwd command implementation
-- pwd prints the current working directory

-- Get current working directory
-- Note: This requires a builtin function getCwd to be implemented
let pwd = fn args ->
  -- For now, we'll use a placeholder that would need a builtin
  -- When getCwd builtin is available, this would be:
  -- let currentDir = getCwd () in
  -- perform print currentDir
  perform print "[pwd command requires getCwd builtin]"

-- Export for use in shell
pwd
