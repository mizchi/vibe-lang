# Code-based test example

# Define functions to test
let add x y = x + y
let multiply x y = x * y

# Define test functions (with a dummy parameter since we can't use fn () ->)
let testAdd = fn dummy = 
  let result = add 2 3 in
  assert (result == 5) "2 + 3 should equal 5"

let testMultiply = fn dummy =
  let result = multiply 3 4 in
  assert (result == 12) "3 * 4 should equal 12"

# Run tests by calling test builtin
let test1 = test "addition test" testAdd
let test2 = test "multiplication test" testMultiply

# Return something to make the file valid
print "Tests registered"
