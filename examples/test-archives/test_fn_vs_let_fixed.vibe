# Testing fn syntax vs let syntax

# fn syntax - creates a Lambda expression
let lambda1 = fn x = x + 1
let lambda2 = fn x -> y = x + y
let lambda3 = fn x = fn y = x + y

# let function syntax - creates FunctionDef or nested Lambda
let func1 x = x + 1
let func2 x y = x + y

# let with type annotations
let func3 x:Int -> Int = x + 1
let func4 x:Int y:Int -> Int = x + y

# Testing both in use
let test1 = lambda1 5
let test2 = func1 5
let test3 = lambda2 3 4
let test4 = func2 3 4
