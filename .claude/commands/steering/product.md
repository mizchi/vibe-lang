# Vibe Language - Product Overview

## Product Overview

Vibe Language is a purely functional programming language specifically designed for AI-assisted "vibe coding" - a development style focused on experimentation, iteration, and trial-and-error. It combines the mathematical rigor of functional programming with practical features that make it ideal for rapid prototyping and AI-driven code generation.

## Core Features

- **Complete Type Inference**: Hindley-Milner type system with let-polymorphism requires minimal type annotations
- **Content-Addressed Code Storage**: Unison-style hash-based code management for precise version control
- **Extensible Effect System**: Track and control side effects while maintaining functional purity
- **Auto-Currying**: Automatic partial application for flexible function composition
- **Pattern Matching**: Exhaustive pattern matching on lists, ADTs, and custom data types
- **WebAssembly Target**: Compile to WebAssembly components for platform-independent deployment
- **AI-Friendly Design**: Structured error messages and predictable semantics optimized for AI understanding
- **Interactive Shell (vsh)**: Advanced REPL with search, history, and code exploration features
- **Incremental Compilation**: Fast feedback loops with Salsa-based incremental type checking
- **Namespace Management**: Hierarchical organization with content-based dependency tracking

## Target Use Cases

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Optimized for code generation and modification by AI tools
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick experimentation with immediate type feedback
- **Educational Programming**: Learn functional programming concepts with clear error messages
- **WebAssembly Applications**: Build portable, high-performance web applications
- **Research and Experimentation**: Explore new programming patterns with strong safety guarantees
- **Component-Based Systems**: Create reusable, composable software components

## Key Value Proposition

1. **Zero Runtime Errors**: Complete type safety and effect tracking eliminate runtime surprises
2. **AI-First Design**: Language features specifically chosen to maximize AI comprehension and generation accuracy
3. **Effortless Refactoring**: Content-addressed code makes renaming and restructuring trivial
4. **Instant Feedback**: Incremental compilation provides immediate type checking results
5. **Pure Functional Benefits**: Referential transparency enables confident reasoning about code
6. **Modern Developer Experience**: Advanced tooling with LSP, MCP, and interactive shell support
7. **WebAssembly Performance**: Compile to efficient WebAssembly for production deployment
8. **Gradual Learning Curve**: Start simple with inference, add types and effects as needed

## Design Philosophy

Vibe Language embraces the idea that programming should be exploratory and iterative. By combining strong static guarantees with excellent tooling and AI-friendly semantics, it creates an environment where developers can "vibe" with their code - experimenting freely while maintaining correctness and clarity.

The language prioritizes developer productivity through:
- Minimal syntax that doesn't sacrifice expressiveness
- Error messages that guide rather than frustrate
- Tools that encourage exploration and discovery
- A type system that helps rather than hinders
